# AI Integration

Kora AI activities use Control Room AI Settings. This lets users bring their own provider, endpoint, key, model, and request settings.

Kora supports a Bring Your Own Key model for AI features. This means each user or company connects their own AI provider account instead of sharing a central Kora-owned AI subscription.

These settings also power Kora Agents. An agent can use the configured model for goal interpretation, context-aware decisions, and tool selection while the Kora runtime performs approved automation actions.

## What This Is For

AI Settings are used by AI-powered activities inside Kora, including:

- AI Prompt
- AI Vision
- AI Table Extract
- AI Extract Document Fields
- AI Knowledge Search
- AI Understand Screen
- AI Find Element
- AI Click
- AI Type into Text field
- AI Read Screen
- AI Verify Screen
- AI Extract Details From
- Kora Copilot, when enabled

Once configured, these activities can reuse the same provider endpoint, API key, model, temperature, and token settings.

## Why Bring Your Own Key

Bring Your Own Key gives customers control over:

- AI provider choice
- API usage cost
- model selection
- data handling policies
- provider billing
- organization-level access controls

Kora does not need to resell AI credits for this mode. The customer pays their AI provider directly.

## Supported Provider Type

The current AI Settings screen supports OpenAI-compatible chat completion endpoints.

Example endpoint:

```text
https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
```

## AI Activities

- [AI Prompt.md](Activities/AI%20Capabilities/AI%20Prompt.html)
- [AI Extract Documents Fields.md](Activities/AI%20Capabilities/AI%20Extract%20Documents%20Fields.html)
- [AI Vision.md](Activities/AI%20Capabilities/AI%20Vision.html)
- [AI Table Extract.md](Activities/AI%20Capabilities/AI%20Table%20Extract.html)
- [AI Knowledge Search RAG.md](Activities/AI%20Capabilities/AI%20Knowledge%20Search%20RAG.html)

## AI Screen Control Activities

AI Screen Control uses a vision-capable model together with screenshots, OCR, and Windows UI information to understand and operate visible applications through natural-language instructions.

- [AI Screen Control overview](Activities/AI%20Screen%20Control/README.html)
- [AI Understand Screen](Activities/AI%20Screen%20Control/AI%20Understand%20Screen.html)
- [AI Find Element](Activities/AI%20Screen%20Control/AI%20Find%20Element.html)
- [AI Click](Activities/AI%20Screen%20Control/AI%20Click.html)
- [AI Type into Text field](Activities/AI%20Screen%20Control/AI%20Type%20into%20Text%20field.html)
- [AI Read Screen](Activities/AI%20Screen%20Control/AI%20Read%20Screen.html)
- [AI Verify Screen](Activities/AI%20Screen%20Control/AI%20Verify%20Screen.html)
- [AI Extract Details From](Activities/AI%20Screen%20Control/AI%20Extract%20Details%20From.html)

Keep the target application visible and unlocked. In unattended or VM execution, the Kora User Agent must run inside the active Windows user session.

## Smart Rule-Based Operations

Smart operations are not provider-based AI calls. They are local rule, regex, and fuzzy matching helpers.

- [Smart Operations](Activities/Smart%20Operations/README.html)

## Configuration

Open:

```text
Control Room > AI Settings
```

Configure:

- Provider
- Endpoint URL
- API key
- Model
- Temperature
- Max tokens

## Voice and Audio

The same AI Settings page stores workspace-level Speech to Text and Text to Speech configuration. Test the transcription endpoint before using the microphone in Agent Chat. Kora sends recorded audio through its server so provider credentials are not returned to the browser.

Normal text chat remains text-first: it does not automatically play replies or display a Listen control. For a continuous spoken conversation, enable Speech to Text and Text to Speech, enable speech for the agent, and turn on **Voice only** in Agent Chat. Leaving Voice only stops listening and returns to the standard composer.

## Typical Use Cases

- Summarize extracted browser or document text.
- Convert free-form text into structured JSON.
- Classify emails or queue items.
- Extract fields from OCR or document output.
- Analyze screenshots, receipts, charts, barcodes, and QR codes.
- Extract table rows from PDFs or images.
- Ask questions from a policy, SOP, folder, or link.
- Understand the controls, forms, tables, and text visible on an application screen.
- Find, click, and type into UI elements described in natural language.
- Verify that an expected screen or application state is visible.
- Extract a named set of details from a visible application into a structured Object with AI Extract Details From.

## Agents and AI Activities

AI activities perform focused tasks inside a workflow. A Kora Agent operates at a higher level: it receives a goal, uses context to select from approved workflows or activities, observes each result, and decides whether to continue, finish, or ask for human input.

The current Agent Builder supports knowledge-base retrieval and citations, per-agent model settings, version history, declared flow inputs and outputs, specialist-agent delegation, deterministic guardrails, a test playground, and locally published embedded chat.

## Notes

Do not hard-code API keys inside workflow steps. Use Control Room AI Settings or secured environment configuration.
