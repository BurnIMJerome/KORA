# Kora Agentic Process Automation

Kora is a Windows-first Agentic Process Automation platform, also called Agentic RPA, for building, running, and managing governed AI agents and reliable workflows across desktop apps, browsers, Excel, files, queues, APIs, scripts, and AI-powered tasks.

It is designed for teams that want practical automation without being forced into a large enterprise platform before they are ready.

## What Kora Does

Kora helps users automate outcomes by combining goal-driven AI agents with a low-code Process Designer, Control Room, and robot runtime. Agents can understand context and choose approved tools, while RPA workflows provide reliable execution for repeatable business actions.

Core capabilities:

- Build versioned agents with knowledge bases, citations, session memory, approved flow tools, and specialist-agent delegation.
- Apply deterministic agent guardrails, flow risk levels, per-message approvals, secret redaction, and destination restrictions.
- Chat with saved agents, reopen conversation history, pop out the active session, and publish locally embedded chat experiences.
- Build flows visually in Process Designer.
- Run flows interactively during development.
- Schedule unattended runs.
- Process queue items.
- Monitor run logs and robot jobs.
- Use AI Capabilities for prompts, document extraction, vision, table extraction, and knowledge search.
- Use AI Screen Control to understand, find, click, type into, read, verify, and extract specific details from visible application screens.
- Use Smart Operations for local fuzzy matching, parsing, normalization, and extraction.
- Use System activities to manage processes, run batch files, and inspect the robot machine and user.
- Automate Windows desktop applications.
- Automate modern browsers.
- Read and write Excel workbooks.
- Work with files, folders, APIs, scripts, and data tables.
- Connect AI providers through Control Room AI Settings.
- Choose SQLite, PostgreSQL/Supabase, or Microsoft SQL Server from Control Room Database settings.
- Run robots on local machines or separate VM resources.

### Control Room

Use the redesigned Control Room to manage agents, knowledge, flows, schedules, runs, logs, global variables, queues, robots, AI settings, database settings, and licensing. It includes grouped navigation, light/dark themes, and Local Runner CPU, memory, heartbeat, and current-flow status.

### Database Options

Use SQLite automatically for local installations, or configure PostgreSQL/Supabase or Microsoft SQL Server for shared deployments. Test the connection before saving; the selection takes effect after restart.

[Database Settings](Database%20Settings.html)

### Unattended Robots

Run scheduled and triggered jobs through `KoraRobotService` and `KoraUserAgent`, including distributed VM robot setups.

### AI Integration

Bring your own AI provider and configure it in Control Room. Kora provides workflow activities for prompting, document field extraction, vision, table extraction, and knowledge search without forcing a separate AI platform subscription.

## Advantages

## Start Small

Kora can run as a local desktop automation studio. A user can install it, build a flow, and run it on one machine without needing a server or enterprise orchestrator.

## Scale When Needed

When the automation program grows, Kora can expand into schedules, queues, Control Room, robot jobs, and VM robots.

## Own The Runtime

Kora is designed for teams that want control over where automation runs: local machine, on-premise server, VM robot, or private infrastructure.

## Bring Your Own AI

Kora connects to the AI provider configured by the user. The platform does not need to sit between the user and the provider as a markup layer.

## Practical Activity Coverage

Kora focuses on the activities automation builders use every day:

- Browser
- Desktop
- Excel
- Files
- Queues
- APIs
- Scripts
- Data tables
- Flow control
- Mouse and keyboard
- Monitor
- Message boxes
- AI
- Event triggers

## Product Vision

Kora's vision is to make Agentic Process Automation accessible, practical, governable, and owned by the people who build it.

The product direction is:

- Keep the designer approachable.
- Keep activity behavior clear and predictable.
- Support real-world Windows automation.
- Let teams start locally and scale gradually.
- Keep orchestration optional until it is needed.
- Support private infrastructure and distributed robot setups.
- Let users choose their AI provider.
- Combine adaptive agent decisions with predictable workflow execution.
- Keep agents bounded by approved tools, credentials, limits, and human approval rules.
- Build a product that small teams can afford and developers can enjoy using.
